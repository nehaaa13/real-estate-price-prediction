# Real Estate Price Prediction

The Real Estate Price Prediction Application is a data science and machine learning project built using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. This application aims to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>

- <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Cleans and transforms real estate data for better model performance.
- <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Uses Matplotlib to visualize trends, correlations, and patterns in housing prices.
- <b>Feature Engineering:</b> Identifies and selects the most relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.
- <b>Machine Learning Models:</b> Implements algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict property prices.
- <b>Model Evaluation:</b> Uses metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess model performance.
- <b>User Interaction:</b> Allows users to input property details and get predicted prices based on trained models.
